# C-Course
My adventure with learning C# and sample challenges/practice I've done while learning!

If you're new or even have experience in working with C#, this code is some stuff I've been learing while taking a course online. If you maybe even just need examples
a certain topic such as Dictionaries, Arrays, Lists, etc., this is a good spot to check out some good examples of how the syntax should be. I will note that one thing
I recommend doing, is when you create a new class, do it outside of your Program.cs. It's easier to read each file if you build the classes outside of the Program.cs and 
instead just call them. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions/concerns/comments. 

Also, feel free to add me on GitHub or LinkedIn. I always enjoy speaking about code with fellow developers!
